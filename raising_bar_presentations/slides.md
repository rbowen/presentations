# Why I care about this topic

## (and why you should care)

???

Know what your talk is about
I should leave your talk wanting to do something. Everone in your talk
should know what that thing is. You should know what that thing is. You
should mention it constantly.

If someone missed your talk, what would you tell them it's about? Does
that take more than 3 sentences?


Show, don't tell

Do not read your slides to me. If your slides are the presentation, then
what are you here for?

Talk to me, not at me

Use the mic

Slow down. Dramatic pauses, rather than ums. (What are ums, ahs, called
in speech jargon?)

Listen to yourself. Cringe a lot. And then figure out why.

One slide per minute. Find your own cadence, but don't give the audience
a chance to look at their phone, for fear they'll miss something.

Slides should evoke images, not list your point. Make them work a little
to make the connection, so that they'll remember it. Throw in the
occasional random non-sequitur
