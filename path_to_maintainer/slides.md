# Why I care about this topic

## (and why you should care)

???

Increasingly, over the years, I am seeing people content to Consume and
Complain, rather than taking any kind of ownership of open source. This
is deeply concerning, because it means that:

1) You are blindly trusting that someone else will do the right thing on
a project you rely on.

2) You are taking the role of customer, and expecting the world to
revolve around you. This is not how open source works, and you *will* be
disappointed.

3) You will be completely unprepared if the project takes an unexpected
direction, changes license, or ceases to operate. Becoming a maintainer
gives you more control of your destiny.

You are, in short, treating the project as a proprietery shrink-wrap
product, rather than an open source project, and are thus missing out on
the majority of the benefits of open source. And you are treating the
(volunteer!) maintainers as your employees, which they are not.

Definition: There is no consistent, standard definition.

At the ASF, we divide it into Committer and PMC Member. Committers can
make changes to the source code. PMC members are the gatekeepers on
releases, and determine who will become a committer or PMC member.

In general, it refers to someone who makes decisions about a project.

# Why do you care?

???

Not just because I said so. Understand your own reasons, and how it
benefits you (personally) and your team.

You should know why you want to become a maintainer. Hopefully it
includes "because I care about the project" at some level.

If you're just doing it because it seems like the thing to do, you're
going to find a lot of this advice just frustrating.

# How?

???

The rest of this talk is practical advice of how to become a
committer/maintainer

Patience.

Earning trust takes time. If you are impatient, or pushy, you will be
unsuccessful.

![Listen](images/listen.jpg)

???

Listen more than you speak. Learn the community norms. Find out who the
cast of characters is. Figure out where the community pain points are -
what's not getting done? Who is getting burned out? How can you help
with that?

Offering solutions that don't solve any real problems isn't going to get
you closer to your goal.

???

* You will never become a maintainer if nobody knows you're there.
* Where does the community chat? You should be a regular there.
  * Answer questions
  * Vote when a decision is being made. (Make it clear that you're
    opinionated, but not authoritative. In Apache we call this
    "non-binding")

---

* Be useful
    * Review PRs, Issues
    * Improve the docs
    * Summarize discussions
* Be welcoming
    * Be the mentor you wish you had
    * Acknowledge and thank new contributors
    * Improve the onboarding documentation (if there even is any!)
* Be an owner, not a renter
    Don't act like an outsider trying to break in. Act like you're at
    home and just haven't been given your own keys yet.
