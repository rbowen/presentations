## Title: The Path To Maintainer

### Idea: 

Talk about how to progress from a contributor to a maintainer.
Of course this varies greatly from one project to another, but there
are some things that are universal ways to earn trust in a project:

* Reviewing PRs/patches
* Testing, and improving, the documentation
* Writing and running tests
* Providing end-user support

## Title: Why single-vendor projects hurt everyone

### Idea:

Discuss why vendor neutrality is good for open source projects, users,
and participating companies. Discuss the risks of using, or creating,
single-vendor projects. Discuss the difference between vendor-led and
vendor-controlled projects.

### Abstract:

TBD

### Notes

* Even if you're the leader, it hurts you, because people will be
  reluctant to contribute because 1) you're already paying a team to do
  the work 2) why should I do your work for you for free so that you
  can charge me to use it and 3) not sure I trust you not to change the
  license some day.
* Project is always at risk of the dominant company changing their
  direction, or changing their mind entirely, leaving you holding the
  bag.

## Title: If you build it ... The art of community growth

### Idea:

Tips for being more welcoming.

### Abstract:

It's an alarmingly common assumption that once you make something open
source, "the community" will show up to work on it. The reality is that
building community is hard work.

While there's no guaranteed way to grow your project community, there's
things you can do to make it more likely that people will show up, get
involved, and stick around. Some of these are obvious, while others may
be less so.

### Notes

* Tell people how to contribute
* Tell people what the path is to being a maintainer
* Welcome each newcomer, individually, in public
* Hand out the keys earlier rather than later
* Recognize that their voice (at least) as important as yours
* ...

## Title: Why Open Source Matters

## Idea: 

For a newbie audience, explain very simply what open source is, and why
they should care. Geared primarily to a non-technical, customer-facing
audience who needs to know enough to know what to say to customers, and
how to understand what customers are saying.

## Audience: Beginners

## Abstract

Open source is in everything, and is a huge part of your business,
whether or not you are aware of it. Understanding what open source is
and how your company interacts with it is critical to earning and
keeping customer trust. Just as importantly, being ignorant of open
source exposes your company to numerous risks. In this talk, we'll learn
what open source is, why you should care, and what are these hidden
risks.

## Title: Talking with management about open source

### Abstract

For those of us who already know how important open source is, it can be challenging to persuasively make the case to management, because we assume that everyone already knows the basics. This can work against us, confusing our audience and making us come across as condescending or concerned about irrelevant lofty philosophical points.

In this talk, we take it back to the basics. What does management actually need to know about open source, why it matters, and how to make decisions about consuming open source, contributing to open source, and open sourcing company code?

## Title: Raising the bar on your conference presentation

## Abstract

We've all attended - or given - presentations that put the audience to sleep, or at least had most of them playing Candy Crush on their phones. In this presentation, we talk about ways that you can improve your conference presentations by making a few simple changes.

You know the presentations I'm talking about. The slides are 73 lines of 12-point font, and the speaker reads them to you with their back turned. Ok, maybe not that bad. But you want to leave the audience wanting more, and eager to take the next step. Here's a few simple tips for making your conference presentations engaging, rather than soporific.
