* PMC member, Apache Training
* ASF advocate in my day job, and I need a starter deck for stuff (ie,
  this is 100% self-serving, as all open source should be.)
--

== Apache Training

image:training.png[width=15%]

* ðŸ’¥ New TLP project (As of last month!)
* Open source training material, and the tools to maintain and publish them
* Slides! Workshops! Labs! Tutorials!
* Come help us!

== Why Apache Training?

[.notes]
--
* 900 "Apache Way" talks with very different perspectives
* Crowdsource a shared view, with peer review of materials
* IP approved resources (appropriate image attribution, for example)
* Presenters can give it their own personality, and then contribute to
  the shared presentation, all under the Apache 2.0 license.

== What it is Not

[.notes]

* We are not providing professional skills certification
* We *may* offer some kind of "badge" for completion of training, in the future. Come help us figure out what that looks like.

== Slide format: AsciiDoctor

image:asciidoctor-logo.png[width=15%]

* Simple markdown style markup
* MIT license
* Multiple outputs
* https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor

image:asciidoc-qr.png[]

[.notes]
--
There are strong feelings in the AsciiDoctor vs Markdown vs
reStructuredText debate. I find them pretty much the same for practical
purposes.
--

== AsciiDoctor Reveal.js

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/reveal.js-converter/latest/

* HTML / CSS
* Reveal.js
* Ruby, Node, Maven

image:reveal-qr.png[]

[.notes]
--
* Creates HTML and CSS output from your AsciiDoctor slides
* Provides several mechanisms for conversion. We're using the Maven one
--

== Text vs other formats

* Easy to edit
* Easy to translate
* Real version control
* Searchable

== Things to work on

* Releases and versioning of presentations?
* Ease of use and reuse of content.
* Is ALv2 the best license for content?

[.notes]
--
The "Apache Software License" was renamed to the "Apache Licence" in v2
*specifically* so that it could be unambiguously used for
documentation. That came, in part,  out of a discussion around the httpd
documentation and the right license for it.
--

== Slide Features
* Speaker notes / timer
* Keyboard navigation
* Vertical slides
* Simple markup
* Styled via CSS
* PDF generation

== Steps to build slides

Content goes in `src/main`

* Edit the `index.adoc` file in `asciidoc`
* Images go in `resources/images`
* Build with `mvn install`

== Converting ...

[.notes]
--
Yes, it's a bit of a hassle having to manually rebuild every time you
make an edit. If you have ideas of how to fix that, come help.

This is the next slide

=== And another
How deep does the rabbit hole go?
